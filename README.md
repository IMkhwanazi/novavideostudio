# Nova Video Studio

BUILD PROMPT — AI VIDEO GENERATION PLATFORM

Build a fully functional, production-ready AI video generation web application called VIDEONOVA AI.

The platform should be an advanced AI content creation studio that allows users to generate professional-quality videos from text prompts, images, scripts, and existing media. The website must feel like a premium AI SaaS product rather than a simple landing page.

The priority is functionality, speed, reliability, excellent UX, and a realistic AI-video-generation workflow.

1. CORE PRODUCT

Create an AI-powered video creation platform where users can:

Generate videos from text prompts.

Generate videos from images.

Turn scripts into complete videos.

Create cinematic AI scenes.

Generate social-media videos.

Create advertisements.

Create product videos.

Create explainer videos.

Create educational videos.

Create music/video visualisers.

Generate multiple scenes within one video.

Add AI voiceovers.

Add background music.

Add subtitles/captions.

Edit generated videos.

Regenerate individual scenes.

Extend videos.

Change video style.

Export finished videos.

The application should behave like a combination of an AI video generator, creative studio, and lightweight video editor.

2. VISUAL IDENTITY

Design the platform with a premium futuristic aesthetic.

Colour palette

Primary:

Deep black

Charcoal

White

Accent:

Electric violet

Soft blue/purple gradients

Use subtle gradients, glassmorphism, soft shadows, glowing borders, and smooth animations.

Avoid excessive visual effects. The interface must remain professional and easy to use.

Typography

Use a modern sans-serif font such as:

Inter

Geist

Manrope

Use large, confident headings and highly readable interface text.

3. LANDING PAGE

Create a high-converting landing page.

Allow users to hide/show advanced settings.

10. AI GENERATION ENGINE

Build the application architecture so that AI video models can be connected through APIs.

Do NOT create a fake generation system that simply displays a pre-existing video.

Implement a proper asynchronous generation architecture.

The application should support configurable AI providers.

Create an abstraction layer such as:

VideoGenerationProvider


with support for providers such as:

Runway

Kling

Luma

Google Veo

OpenAI-compatible video APIs

Other future video-generation providers

The provider should be configurable through environment variables.

Example architecture:

User Prompt
      ↓
Prompt Enhancement AI
      ↓
Scene Generator
      ↓
Video Generation Provider
      ↓
Generation Queue
      ↓
Processing
      ↓
Storage
      ↓
Video Preview
      ↓

Create tables for:

users

subscriptions

projects

scenes

generations

generation_jobs

assets

videos

audio

templates

credits

transactions

brand_kits

exports

notifications

Use proper foreign keys and indexes.

32. FILE STORAGE

Use scalable object storage for:

Videos

Images

Audio

Thumbnails

Project assets

Do not store large video files directly inside the relational database.

Use signed URLs for private media.

33. PERFORMANCE

Performance is extremely important.

Implement:

Lazy loading

CDN delivery

Image optimisation

Video thumbnails

Background processing

Caching

Database indexing

API request throttling

Job queues

Retry logic

Error handling

The application should remain responsive even while videos are being generated.

34. RESPONSIVE DESIGN

Tablet

Mobile

The video editor should prioritise desktop but remain usable on tablets and mobile.

35. SECURITY

Implement:

Authentication

Authorisation

Rate limiting

Input validation

API key protection

Secure file uploads

File type validation

Signed media URLs

CSRF protection where applicable

XSS protection

Flag or reject requests involving:

Illegal content

Explicit sexual content

Exploitative content

Dangerous instructions

Non-consensual intimate imagery

Impersonation/deceptive deepfakes

Copyright-infringing requests where applicable

For sensitive generation requests, provide a clear explanation rather than silently failing.

or:

Saving...

40. EMPTY STATES

Do not leave blank pages.

For example:

"No projects yet."

Then:

Create your first AI video →

Use helpful illustrations and clear CTAs.

41. ERROR STATES

Every API request must have proper error handling.

Never show raw backend errors to users.

Instead show understandable messages.

Example:

"Your video couldn't be generated this time. Try again or adjust your prompt."

Buttons:

Retry

Edit Prompt

42. AI PROMPT INTELLIGENCE

Build an AI prompt enhancement layer.

If the user writes:

"Make a video of a car."

The system should internally expand it into a detailed generation prompt containing:

Subject

Environment

Camera

Lighting

Motion

Composition

Style

Duration

Atmosphere

The user should be able to see the enhanced prompt and edit it.

43. GENERATION PREVIEW

Before spending credits, display:

Generation Summary

Duration:
10 seconds

Resolution:
1080p

Aspect Ratio:
16:9

Model:
Selected AI model

Estimated credits:
50

Buttons:

Generate

Cancel

44. MODEL SELECTION

Create an advanced model selector.

Example:

AI Video Model

Fast

Balanced

Cinematic

High Quality

Display:

Speed

Quality

Credit cost

Allow the backend to map these options to actual providers/models.

Do not hardcode provider-specific assumptions into the frontend.

45. API ARCHITECTURE

Use a clean backend architecture.

Suggested structure:

/frontend
/backend
/services
/providers
/database
/storage
/workers
/api


Create a provider interface:

generateVideo()
getGenerationStatus()
cancelGeneration()
extendVideo()
generateImageToVideo()


Each provider adapter should implement the interface.

This allows new AI video providers to be added without rewriting the application.

46. REAL-TIME GENERATION STATUS

Use WebSockets or Server-Sent Events where appropriate.

When a generation job changes:

Backend:

generation_status = processing


Frontend immediately updates the interface.

Do not require users to manually refresh the page.

47. API ENDPOINTS

Create secure endpoints similar to:

POST /api/video/generate
GET /api/video/generations/:id
POST /api/video/generations/:id/cancel
POST /api/video/generations/:id/retry
POST /api/video/generations/:id/extend

POST /api/scenes
PUT /api/scenes/:id
DELETE /api/scenes/:id

POST /api/scripts/generate
POST /api/voice/generate
POST /api/music/generate

POST /api/export
GET /api/projects
POST /api/projects
PUT /api/projects/:id
DELETE /api/projects/:id


Validate every request server-side.

48. DEMO MODE

If API keys are not configured during development, create a Demo Mode.

Demo Mode should simulate:

Generation queue

Progress

Scene generation

Video completion

Export

Clearly label Demo Mode.

Do not pretend that simulated videos are actual AI-generated videos.

The architecture must make replacing Demo Mode with real providers straightforward.

49. LANDING PAGE FEATURES

Add a section:

One Prompt. Endless Possibilities.

Feature cards:

Text to Video

Turn ideas into cinematic scenes.

Image to Video

Bring static images to life.

AI Scripts

Generate scripts designed for engagement.

AI Voice

Create natural voiceovers.

AI Music

Generate original background music.

Smart Editing

Let AI handle repetitive editing.

50. FINAL CTA

Create a large CTA section:

Your next video starts with one idea.

Subheading:

Describe it. Generate it. Make it yours.

Button:

Start Creating Free

51. FOOTER

Include:

VIDEONOVA AI

"Create without limits."

Links:

52. TECH STACK

Use a modern production-ready stack.

Preferred:

Frontend:

Next.js

React

TypeScript

Tailwind CSS

UI:

shadcn/ui

Lucide icons

Backend:

Next.js API routes or dedicated Node.js backend

Database:

PostgreSQL

ORM:

Prisma

Authentication:

Auth.js or equivalent

Storage:

S3-compatible object storage

Payments:

Stripe

Queue:

Redis + BullMQ or equivalent

Real-time:

WebSockets or Server-Sent Events

Deployment:

Vercel for frontend

Scalable cloud infrastructure for workers/backend

53. CODE QUALITY

Write clean, modular, maintainable production-quality code.

Use:

TypeScript

Strong typing

Reusable components

Service layers

Provider abstractions

Error boundaries

Validation schemas

API middleware

Environment variables

Unit tests

Integration tests

Do not put everything into one massive component.

54. IMPORTANT FUNCTIONALITY REQUIREMENT

Do NOT build this as merely a visual mockup.

Every major button should have a functional flow.

For example:

Generate Video
→ validate request
→ estimate credits
→ create generation job
→ send job to provider
→ track status
→ store output
→ update project
→ display completed video.

Regenerate Scene
→ create scene-generation job
→ process scene
→ replace scene output
→ update timeline.

Export
→ process project
→ render video
→ create export
→ provide secure download/share link.

55. FINAL QUALITY STANDARD

The finished application should feel comparable to a modern commercial AI SaaS platform.

Prioritise:

Functional AI video generation

Fast and responsive UI

Excellent user experience

Reliable generation pipeline

Scalable architecture

Professional video editor

High-quality visual design

Secure API architecture

Proper error handling

Easy integration of future AI models

Build the application so that a real AI video-generation API can be connected immediately through environment variables without requiring major frontend changes.

Do not use fake functionality in production paths.

If an external AI provider is unavailable, gracefully display the appropriate status and allow the user to retry or switch models.

The final product should feel like a serious AI video-generation company, not a prototype.
